# TnTPack focused on tech and adventure (pack name may change)

The modpack primary goal is a tech and adventure with genetics thrown in, themed pack. The main focus is to provide an alternative interesting way to play minecraft. Pack is designed to give you a steady progression along your path to more amazing tools and machines later on. Don’t expect to craft a bucket and iron tool on your first day, unless you’re lucky.

Also this pack is for players who are perhaps looking for a different kind challenge. So players who are new to playing modded minecraft might find this pack is not for you, but feel free to give it a try if you dare. :D

Please refer to our [GitHub](https://github.com/tntblockman/TnTpack-Modpack) page for full mod list.

For all issues you encounter related to pack, please post your issue here [issue page](https://github.com/tntblockman/TnTpack-Modpack/issues).

Some hints as to what you’re about to get yourself into with this pack;

* Infinite water is disabled 
* All ore generating is handled by GregTech
* Caving is not as safe anymore
* Dungeons are not what they seem
* Day and night time cycles are doubled

We’re always open to ideas/suggestions from the public as to what to add or change to future versions of pack.  But keep these main pack objectives in mind when suggesting ideas on the forum;

* RF(power) is to be kept to an absolute bare minimum.
* Power mostly focused with EU and pressure (Pneumaticcraft).
* Keep mod dimensions to a minimum.
* Mod has to have unique features and not just repeat features that are already provided by other mods in the pack.        Example would be we don’t want to have 20+ other mods that add tubes or pipes for transportation in the pack.
